# Concurrent-traffic-intersection-simulator
 Built a generic simulator in Elixir that models intersections using a  configurable JSON for streets, traffic lights and car arrivals. Leveraged Erlang processes, computing 1 million cars  in 0.37s and outputting a text file including average wait times and intersection performance percentiles.
